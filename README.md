# Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a Neural Network and Fuzzy Logic approach. The model is designed to help in the early diagnosis and treatment of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises historical data on heart diseases from Cleveland, Ohio, provided by the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository. It includes 13 features like age, sex, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.

## Features
1. Age
2. Sex
3. Chest Pain Type
4. Resting Blood Pressure
5. Serum Cholesterol
6. Fasting Blood Sugar
7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results
8. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
9. Exercise Induced Angina
10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest
11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
12. Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
13. Thal
14. Target

## Methodology
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and typecasting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Histograms and heatmaps to understand variable distribution and correlation.
- **Model Building**: Neural Network with Dense and Dropout layers, using the Adam optimizer.
- **Training**: Model trained on 80% of the data with categorical and binary inputs.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss metrics comparison.
